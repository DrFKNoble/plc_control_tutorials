## Sample Problems

1. A conveyor and a mechanism are used to sort red and black objects into their corresponding bins. The conveyor has a sensor at its beginning that is used to detect an object's color. When an object is detected, the conveyor's motor turns on. When an object is detected, an actuator may move its attached linkage to sort the object into its proper bin. Objects take at least 1 second to be sorted after being detected. After an object has been sorted, the conveyor's motor turns off. After an object has been sorted, if the actuator moved its attached linkage, it moves back to its default location.
